# LIV Avatar Camera Custom Path Plugin
A plugin to control the LIV avatar camera using custom paths.
### Editor
You can snag the path editor [here](https://github.com/realityquintupled/LIV-CustomPathCameraBehaviour-Editor/releases).
### Controls
After opening the avatar menu in your headset and selecting this plugin, three labels will appear in front of you. One shows the name of the currently selected path, and the other two show `<<` and `>>`. Pushing the latter two with your controller will cycle through your paths backwards or forwards, respectively.
### Notes
* You can create and edit paths while LIV is open, just switch between avatar camera modes to refresh the plugin.
* You can locate your path files by pressing <kbd>Win</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd>, pasting in `%appdata%\..\Local\LIV\CustomCameraPaths`, and pressing <kbd>Return</kbd>. You can use these files to share your paths with other people.
